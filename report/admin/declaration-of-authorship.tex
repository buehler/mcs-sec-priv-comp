	      dissemination of parts or the entire report and that I comply with them
	      accordingly;

	      plagiarism and for third-party authorship of human or technical origin and that I
	      hereby grant the University of St. Gallen the copyright according to the
	      Examination Regulations as far as it is necessary for the administrative actions;
	\item that I am aware that the University will prosecute a violation of this
	      Declaration of Authorship and that disciplinary as well as criminal consequences
	      may result, which may lead to expulsion from the University or to the withdrawal of
	      my title.
\end{itemize}

\noindent By submitting this report, I confirm through my conclusive action that I
